Foodweb
A curated collection of React Native components developed for Foodweb, an invoice scanning platform designed to empower restaurant owners with data-driven purchasing insights. Similar to how Glassdoor provides salary transparency in the employment market, Foodweb analyzes supplier invoices to reveal comprehensive market pricing trends, enabling restaurants to negotiate more effectively with their vendors.
This repository demonstrates key UI components and functionality from the Foodweb ecosystem, providing technical insight into the platform's capabilities while maintaining the privacy of the core application.
