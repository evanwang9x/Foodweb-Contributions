This repository contains selected React Native components from Foodweb, an invoice scanning platform that helps restaurant owners make data-driven purchasing decisions. Similar to how Glassdoor provides salary transparency, Foodweb analyzes supplier invoices to reveal market pricing trends, enabling restaurants to negotiate more effectively with vendors.

## Important Notice

The components in this repository are compartmentalized extracts from the larger Foodweb platform and **will not execute if downloaded and run locally**. Please navigate to the **Pull Requests tab** to access the code, documentation, and video demonstrations of each component.

## Repository Structure

Each pull request contains a distinct component or feature implementation with source code, technical documentation, and live demonstrations of functionality.
