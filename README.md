Iris - Invoice Intelligence Components
A collection of React Native components built for Iris, an invoice scanning platform that empowers restaurant owners to make data-driven purchasing decisions. Similar to how Glassdoor provides salary transparency, Iris analyzes supplier invoices to reveal market pricing trends, helping restaurants negotiate better rates with their vendors.
This repository showcases key UI components and functionality demonstrations from the larger Iris ecosystem, providing insight into the platform's capabilities while keeping the core application private. As such, trying to pull and test the code locally isn't possible and thus is recommended to view the demo videos instead.
